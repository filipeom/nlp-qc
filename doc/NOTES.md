# Question Classification - Notes 

## High Accuracy Rule-based Question Classifcation using Question Syntax and Semantics

Work on QC can be broadly divided into three categories:

* Those that make use of machine learning
* Those that rely purely on rules, and
* those that are a hybrid of the two.

The most popular Question Taxonomy used is the one introduced
by Li and Roth (2002). Their classification is a two level system
which contains a coarse and a fine level of classification for
each question. Table 1 lists the classification introduced by
them.

| Coarse | Fine                                                                                    |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ABBR   | abbreviation, expansion                                                                 |
| DESC   | definition, description, manner, reason                                                 |
